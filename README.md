# Artifact Generator Discord Bot

This is a fan made Java-based Discord bot that generates random artifacts similar to those found in games like *Genshin Impact*. It simulates the creation of artifacts with randomized slot types, main stats, and substats, and outputs them in a Discord-friendly text format.

## Features

- Responds to a Discord command (e.g., `!artifact`) by generating a randomized artifact.
- Each artifact has:
  - A random slot (Flower, Feather, Sands, Goblet, Circlet)
  - A main stat appropriate to the slot
  - Four randomized substats, ensuring no overlap with the main stat or each other
- Produces clean, readable output for Discord
